Commands

- `auth2leg`: Authenticates using 2-legged OAuth with Autodesk services. This command handles the authentication process without user interaction and is suitable for server-to-server communication.
- `auth3leg`: Authenticates using 3-legged OAuth with Autodesk services. This command is used when user consent is required, typically for applications that need to access user-specific data.
- `data-revit-by-categories`: Read Revit data by categories. This command allows you to specify categories to filter the data that you retrieve from Revit files.
- `data-revit-by-cats-params`: Read Revit data by categories and parameters. Use this command to fetch Revit data based on both category and parameter filters, providing more granular control.
- `data-revit-categories`: Read all categories from a specified URN. This command fetches all available categories from a Revit model identified by its URN.
- `data-revit-parameters`: Read all parameters from a specified URN. Similar to the categories command but focused on retrieving all parameters associated with a Revit model.
- `hubs`: Lists all hubs associated with the Autodesk account. This command is useful for managing multiple projects or collaborations across Autodesk services.
- `item-versions`: Retrieves batch information on all item versions. This command provides historical version data for items managed within Autodesk services.
- `items`: Retrieves batch information on all items based on general information criteria. Use this command to get a broad overview of items within a project or hub.
- `login`: Logs into Autodesk services using configured credentials. Essential for initiating sessions and managing authentication states.
- `projects`: Retrieves batch information on all projects. This command offers insights into all projects managed under the user's Autodesk account.
- `refresh-token`: Refreshes the OAuth access token used for authentication. Vital for maintaining access without requiring a full re-authentication process.
- `set-folder`: Sets the default folder for operations that require a folder context. This simplifies subsequent commands by using the set folder as a context.
- `show-ports`: Displays all network ports currently in use on the system. Useful for troubleshooting network issues or conflicts within the application environment.
- `top-folders`: Retrieves batch information on all top folders in a project. Helps in navigating the project's directory structure and managing data more effectively.
